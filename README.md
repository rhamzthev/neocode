## Description

Neocode is a lightweight, terminal-based text editor written in C that focuses on efficiency and minimal resource usage. It uses a piece table data structure for text manipulation, providing efficient editing operations even for large files. Designed with a clean, modular architecture, Neocode offers a responsive editing experience with essential features for developers and writers who prefer working in terminal environments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

```
- GCC or compatible C compiler
- Make build system
- POSIX-compliant operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.)
```

### Dependencies

```
- Standard C libraries only (no external dependencies)
```

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/neocode.git

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
cd neocode

# Step 3: Build the project
make

# Step 4: Run the editor
./bin/ncode [filename]
```

### Platform-Specific Instructions

#### Linux
The editor should build and run on most Linux distributions without modification.

#### macOS
Compatible with macOS. Build using the standard steps above.

#### Windows
Not directly supported. Consider using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for Windows compatibility.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors, ensure your compiler supports C99 standards and that you have proper permissions to create files in the bin/ and obj/ directories.

## Usage

### Basic Example

```bash
# Open a file for editing
./bin/ncode myfile.txt

# Create a new file (will be saved when you exit)
./bin/ncode newfile.txt
```

### Navigation Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move cursor
- **Page Up/Down**: Scroll page by page
- **Home/End**: Move to start/end of line
- **Ctrl+Home/End**: Move to start/end of document
- **Ctrl+Left/Right**: Move by word
- **Mouse**: Click to position cursor, wheel to scroll

### Quitting

- **Ctrl+Q**: Quit the editor

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Efficient text manipulation using piece table data structure
- Terminal-based user interface with minimal resource usage
