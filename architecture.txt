# Proposed Architecture Analysis

Your proposed architecture is definitely feasible and represents a meaningful improvement over the current structure. Let me analyze this proposal:

```ascii
                    +-------+
                    |  UI   |
                    +---+---+
                        |
                        v
                  +-----------+
                  | Viewport  |
                  +-----+-----+
                        ^
                        |
+---------+       +-----v-----+       +--------+
|Terminal |------>|           |<------| Buffer |
+---------+       |  Editor   |       +--------+
                  |           |
+---------+       |           |
|   IO    |------>|           |
+---------+       +-----------+
                        ^
+---------+             |
|Commands |-------------+
+---------+
```

## Benefits of this architecture:

1. **Clear separation of concerns**:
   - UI only renders what viewport determines should be visible
   - Editor acts as the central controller/coordinator
   - Buffer purely manages text storage

2. **Simplified data flow**:
   - Terminal, IO, Commands all feed into Editor
   - Editor mediates all access to the Buffer
   - UI only needs to talk to Viewport

3. **Reduced circular dependencies**:
   - Most relationships are one-directional
   - Only Editor<->Viewport are bidirectional

4. **Better aligned with MVC pattern**:
   - Model: Buffer (data storage)
   - View: UI and Viewport (presentation)
   - Controller: Editor (with Terminal/IO/Commands as inputs)

5. **More maintainable and extensible**:
   - Adding new features is easier with clear interfaces
   - Components can be tested in isolation
   - Potential for plugin system through editor hooks

This architecture would make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand for new contributors.

# Main.c and Editor.c Architecture Analysis

Yes, it's absolutely feasible and actually preferable for main.c to only know about editor.c. This follows the facade pattern, where editor.c provides a simplified interface to the entire system.

## Architecture with main.c focused on editor.c:

```ascii
+----------+
|  main.c  |  (Entry point with minimal knowledge)
+-----+----+
      |
      | (only knows)
      v
+-----+------+
| editor.c   |  (Coordinates everything)
+-----+------+
      |
      | (initializes & manages)
+-----+------+------+------+------+------+
|     |      |      |      |      |      |
v     v      v      v      v      v      v
UI  Buffer  Viewport  IO  Terminal  Commands
```

## Benefits:

1. **Simplified program flow**: 
   - main.c initializes editor.c
   - editor.c initializes everything else
   - main.c runs the main event loop by delegating to editor.c

2. **Clean separation of concerns**:
   - main.c only handles program lifecycle
   - editor.c handles application logic and component coordination

3. **Better encapsulation**:
   - Implementation details are hidden from main.c
   - Makes the codebase more maintainable

4. **Better testability**:
   - editor.c can be tested independently from main.c
   - Makes unit testing more straightforward

In this architecture, main.c would be very thin, perhaps just 30-50 lines that initialize the editor, run the event loop, and handle graceful shutdown. All the actual complexity is encapsulated in editor.c and its managed components.
